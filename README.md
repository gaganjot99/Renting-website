## Renting Out A Place

To find out a place which suits the needs, App lists all the places available on rent in the searched city. Locations of the listing can be seen on the Google map embedded in the website. The type of place or features you want in a place can be easily searched for using filters featured in our app. Price, number of bathrooms and bedrooms, and type filters present.
